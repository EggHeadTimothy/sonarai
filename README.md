# sonarai
This program is a modification of the code of "Sonar Treasure Hunt", removing the user inputs and instead taking inputs from an AI player that follows a set strategy to have the highest chance of finding all the treasure chests. In a test of 1000 attempts, the AI showed an 80.7% win rate.

sonarai.py is the file I wrote, and sonar.py is the original code for "Sonar Treasure Hunt" by Al Sweigart.
